Welcome to Statistics I (and II)!

I would like to announce a few things regarding the logistics of the class.

* I plan to update all class-related information at https://github.com/ysohn/stats 
 - Please visit the website frequently.  
 - Notification messages will be posted at this website as well.

* Your TA is Masanori Kikuchi who is a graduate student in political science and a recent graduate of SPSE BA program. 
 - Please direct all R and RStudio related questions to his email address: waseda.statistics@gmail.com
 - You may ask him about lecture related questions as well, but you can also reach the instructor (ysohn.teaching@gmail.com) if you watn to get further information. 

* Evaluation: This is a P/Q (pass/fail) class. Your performance in this class will be evalulated by weekly quiz sets and a simple R code problem set at the end of the quarter. I do not intend to fail anyone who complete the class materials. Don't be stressed!
 - The first set of quiz will be relased on the second week. Details will be announced around the release. 
 - For logistical concerns (e.g. gpa calculation), please consult with the school office as instructors do not have accurate information.

* Lecture/Lab class video upload: 
 - I am doing my best to find out the best technology.  
 - The files will be uploaded to either the Moodle class page or to https://github.com/ysohn/stats . I will post an announcement when I upload the first week materials.  
 - Each weekly material will be uploaded by the following time every week: 
   - asd

 - Install RStudio (https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)
 - Download and install the one for your operating system under All Installers.
 - Download and unzip zip file for the corresponding week.
