## Notes
Students who are taking Statistics II are assumed to have knowledge in the contents covered in Statistics I and basic R skills. I will provide Statistics I materials to students who are taking Statistics II. We will also review elementary R skills during the first lab class of Statistics II. However, those registered only for Statistics II are STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to AUDIT Statistics I as the contents covered in the first statistics sequence (Statistics I) have been changed from the contents from the past years.

## Regarding RStudio Usage
You can use desktop computers in the computer lab, but I recommend the students to install R and RStudio programs on their own laptops, and bring them to the lab classes (no need to bring them to the lectures). This will help you become more familiar with statistical softwares and make it easier for you to apply the skills you learned to problems outside this class.

1. Install R (https://cran.ism.ac.jp/)
* Download the one for your operating system.
2. Install RStudio (https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)
* Download the one for your operating system under **Installers for Supported Platforms**.
