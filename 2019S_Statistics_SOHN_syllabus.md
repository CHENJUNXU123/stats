## Recommendation
You can use desktop computers in the computer lab, but I recommend the students to install R and RStudio programs on their own laptops, and bring them to the lab classes (no need to bring them to the lectures). This will help you become more familiar with statistical softwares and make it easier for you to apply the skills you learned to problems outside this class.

1. Install R (http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~gulzar/rstudio/)
* The link for Windows is broken. Please visit this link for downloading: https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base
2. Install R Studio (http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~gulzar/rstudio/)
* You can choose the FREE "RStudio Desktop Open Source License." (first one from the left; then choose your operating system)
